# Overpick

**Overpick** is a GUI-based application that assists players in selecting heroes in the game Overwatch. By choosing a hero from the dropdown in the Overpick window and pressing 'M' in-game, the hero is automatically selected, saving the user time and effort, I understand the code might be buggy but this is just a mini-project a solution to a simple problem that not everyone might be facing.

## Usage:
Basically just pick a category from the script, then pick a hero.
When you press M it would do some keystrokes to pick a hero, it's open source you can look at the code yourself if you wanna get more into understanding how it works ðŸ˜Š.

### **[Sometimes it won't work with full screen, so run it as administrator and this currently only works on 1920x1080]**

## Features:

- **Category-based Hero Selection**: Choose heroes based on their categories (e.g., Support, DPS, Tank).
- **Hotkey Selection**: After selecting a hero from the dropdown, press 'M' in-game to quickly choose that hero.
- **Stop Selection**: A feature to stop the "M" hotkey functionality when not needed.
